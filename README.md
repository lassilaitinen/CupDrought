# Cup Drought

A React-app, which shows how it has been since your favorite Liiga team won their latest championship. Yep, it may have been a longer time than you remember. But no worries, some teams are still chasing their first championship. If your team hasn't won any titles, the app shows how long you have been waiting for that very first title.

Alongside showing each team's cup drought, the app shows also a bit more information about each team.
